# Default mode for PostgreSQL

Use default mode to store a list of immutable entries into a PostgreSQL table.

## Usage

In default mode, the transform function must return a list of rows that will be
inserted into the PostgreSQL table.

In this mode, the [only required options](/docs/v1/integrations/postgres/options)
are `tableName` and `connectionString`.

## Table schema

Apibara requires the target table to have a `_cursor bigint` column. This column
is used to track at which block a row is inserted to handle chain
reorganizations.

```sql
create table yourtable(
  -- your columns here
  _cursor bigint
)
```

## Indices

For better performance, you should add an index on the `_cursor` column.
This index is used by the indexer when updating data between pending blocks.

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON yourtable (_cursor);
```
