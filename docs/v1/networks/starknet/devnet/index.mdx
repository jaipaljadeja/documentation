# Usage with Starknet devnets

Apibara works great for local development, simply connect the open-source
Starknet DNA server to devnet. In this guide, we are going to show how to
use DNA with [devnet-rs](https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/starknet-devnet-rs)
and [katana](https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo/tree/main/crates/katana).

You will need the following tools installed:

- [Docker and Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) - required.
- [Httpie](https://httpie.io/) - optional.
- [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) - optional.

**JSON-RPC compatibility**

Notice that the JSON-RPC version used by Starknet DNA for ingestion needs to
match the devnet implementation.

- `apibara/starknet:1.4`: v0.6

## With devnet-rs

The following `docker-compose.yml` file shows how to run devnet-rs and the Starknet DNA
server.

Notice the following:

- we persist the devnet state between restarts with the `--dump-path` option.
- `apibara/starknet` requires the `XDG_DATA_HOME` directory to exist. In this case,
  we map it to a Docker volume.
- the `--rpc` flag connects `apibara/starknet` to `devnet`.
- the DNA service will be exposed on port `7171`.

```yaml [docker-compose.yml]
version: "3"

services:
  devnet:
    image: shardlabs/starknet-devnet-rs:0.0.2
    command:
      - --dump-on=transaction
      - --dump-path=/data/dump
    volumes:
      - devnet:/data
    ports:
      - 5050:5050

  dna:
    image: quay.io/apibara/starknet:1.4.0
    command:
      - start
      - --rpc=http://devnet:5050/rpc
      - --name=devnet
      - --head-refresh-interval-ms=1000
      - --wait-for-rpc
      - --address=0.0.0.0:7171
    environment:
      - XDG_DATA_HOME=/data
    volumes:
      - dna:/data
    ports:
      - 7171:7171
    depends_on:
      devnet:
        condition: service_started

volumes:
  devnet:
  dna:
```

After creating the `docker-compose.yml` file, you can start the services. The
first time you run this command, you will see the DNA service printing an error
at regular intervals. This is normal: DNA expects the network to have at least
one block, but devnet doesn't have any block until the first transaction is
submitted. We are going to see how to easily create transactions in the next section.

### Producing blocks

The easiest way to produce blocks is by using [the `/mint`
helper](https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/starknet-devnet-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#mint-token).
After creating the first transaction, the devnet will start producing blocks and
DNA will ingest them as they're produced.

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
http POST :5050/mint address=0x0 amount:=50000 unit="FRI"
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
access-control-allow-origin: *
content-length: 110
content-type: application/json

## With katana

TODO

## Connecting to the local DNA server

You can now connect to the local DNA server available at the following address.

```txt
http://localhost:7171
```

Check the ingestion status with grpcurl. Notice that because of how gRPC works,
you will need to produce a few blocks for all fields to become visible.

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:7171 apibara.node.v1alpha2.Stream.Status
```

```
{
  "currentHead": {
    "orderKey": "1",
    "uniqueKey": "B4w42Tvx/afQWKMp3TFt/wCR7YIHKKzxOZnhbYC4TV0="
  },
  "lastIngested": {
    "orderKey": "1",
    "uniqueKey": "B4w42Tvx/afQWKMp3TFt/wCR7YIHKKzxOZnhbYC4TV0="
  }
}
