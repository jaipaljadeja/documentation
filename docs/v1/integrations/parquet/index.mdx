# Getting started with the Parquet sink

**Notice**: the Parquet integration is still in the early stage and subject to
change.

The Parquet integration generates datasets containing onchain data.
Parquet is the standard file format used by analytics applications such as:

- The Pandas and Polars data frame libraries for Python.
- DuckDB, an in-process SQL Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) database.

## Installation

```bash [Terminal]
apibara plugins install sink-parquet
```
