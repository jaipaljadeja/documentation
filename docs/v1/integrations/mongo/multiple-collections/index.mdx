# Store data into multiple collections

The MongoDB sink can write data to multiple collections.

## Usage

Change your configuration to use the `collectionNames` option. This mode is
compatible both with the standard mode and with entity mode.

The transform function now works differently:

- For standard mode, put the returned data in a `data`Â key and add a
  `collection` key, the returned value will look like `{ data: any, collection:
string }`
- For entity mode, just add a `collection` key to the returned object, it should
  look like `{ entity: any, collection: string, update: any }`

## Example

The following example shows an indexer that streams `Transfer` events and writes
them to three separate collections: `mints`, `burns`, and `transfers`.

```ts [indexer.ts]
export default function transform({ events }) {
  return (events ?? []).map(({ event }) => {
    if (isMint(event)) {
      return {
        collection: "mints",
        data: extractMint(event),
      };
    } else if (isBurn(event)) {
      return {
        collection: "burns",
        data: extractBurn(event),
      };
    } else {
      return {
        collection: "transfers",
        data: extractTransfer(event),
      };
    }
  });
}
```
