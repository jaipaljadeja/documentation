# Getting started with the console sink

The console sink prints the value returned by the transform function to the standard output.

This sink is useful when developing an indexer since you can quickly check the
value returned by the transformation without setting up any external service.

## Installation

```bash [Terminal]
apibara plugins install sink-console
```

## Usage

This sink doesn't have any configuration option.

```ts [indexer.ts]
export const config = {
  // ...
  sinkType: "console",
  sinkOptions: {},
};
```
