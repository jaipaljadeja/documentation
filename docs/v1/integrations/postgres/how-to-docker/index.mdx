# How to synchronize onchain data to PostgreSQL running in Docker

This guide will show you how to synchronize onchain data to a PostgreSQL instance running in Docker.

## Start Docker container

Start the PostgreSQL Docker container using the Docker CLI.

- We set the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable explicitly to the
  password we want to use, in this case `postgres` (same as username and
  database).
- We expose the default PostgreSQL port (5432) with the `-p 5432:5432` option.
- We ask Docker to delete the container on exit using the `--rm` flag. At every
  restart we will have a fresh instance.

:::cli-command

```bash Terminal
docker run --rm -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres postgres:16
```

```
The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "postgres".
This user must also own the server process.

The database cluster will be initialized with locale "en_US.utf8".
The default database encoding has accordingly been set to "UTF8".
The default text search configuration will be set to "english".

Data page checksums are disabled.

Success. You can now start the database server using:

    pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/data -l logfile start

initdb: warning: enabling "trust" authentication for local connections
initdb: hint: You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or --auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb.

## Verify connection

Before we connect the Apibara sink to the PostgreSQL instance, we test
everything is setup correctly using `psql`.

We use the following options:

- `-h localhost` to connect to the local instance.
- `-U postgres` to connect as the `postgres` user.
- `-W` to input the password.

:::cli-command

```bash Terminal
psql -h localhost -U postgres -W
```

```
Password:
psql (15.5, server 16.2 (Debian 16.2-1.pgdg120+2))
WARNING: psql major version 15, server major version 16.
         Some psql features might not work.
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

## Create tables

While you are connected to the database you can create the tables needed by your indexer.

## Connect the indexer

Set the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable to the following
(refer to the [options](/docs/v1/integrations/postgres/options#connection-string)
page to learn more about connection strings):

```bash [Terminal]
export POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"
```

Run the indexer and after a few seconds you will see onchain data appear in your
database.
