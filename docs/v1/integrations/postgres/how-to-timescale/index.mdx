# How to synchronize onchain data to Timescale

This guide will show you how to synchronize onchain data to your Timescale
instance.

## Grab the Timescale connection string

The first step is to grab the connection string from your Timescale dashboard.
If you have the addon, you should use the "connection pooler" connection string
since the number of concurrent connections is limited.

## Create the table

Use the connection string from the previous point to create the table. In this
tutorial, we are going to use `pgcli` but any tool is fine.

## Connect the indexer

Set the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable to the value copied
from the dashboard.

```bash [Terminal]
export POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING="postgres://tsdbadmin:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[YOUR-INSTANCE].tsdb.cloud.timescale.com:38660/tsdb?sslmode=require"
```

Run the indexer and after a few seconds you will see onchain data appear in your
database.
