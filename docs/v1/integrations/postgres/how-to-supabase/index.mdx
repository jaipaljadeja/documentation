# How to synchronize onchain data to Supabase

This guide will show you how to synchronize onchain data to your Supabase
instance.

## Create a table in Supabase

The first step is to create a table in Supabase. In this case, we are using the
SQL Editor but you can use any tool you like.

## Grab the Supabase connection string

In your project's settings, navigate to the "Database configuration" section and
copy the connection string.

**Note**: you need change the connection string to include the password you set
when creating the database.

## Connect the indexer

Set the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable to the value copied
from Supabase.

```bash [Terminal]
export POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING="postgres://postgres.[YOUR-INSTANCE]:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"
```

Run the indexer and after a few seconds you will see onchain data appear in your
database.
