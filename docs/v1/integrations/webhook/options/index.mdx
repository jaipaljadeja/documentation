# Webhook sink options

This page contains a reference of all available options for the Webhook sink.

## General

- `targetUrl: string`: URL where the stream data will be posted to.
- `raw: boolean`: if set to `true`, the payload will be the data returned by
  the transform function. Otherwise, wrap the data in JSON-object together
  with its cursors.
