# DNA streaming protocol

The Direct Node Access (DNA) streaming protocol is used to efficiently stream
any on-chain data from nodes into applications.

The goals of the protocol are:

- linearize non-linear data into something easy to follow,
- let clients customize the data they want to receive, reducing the bandwidth required,
- provide support for data at all stages of finality (pending, accepted, finalized).

**Note**: understanding the low-level DNA protocol is not required to use
Apibara. This page is provided for developers that want to understand more about
Apibara's implementation details. Knowing how DNA works is useful if you want to
contribute to Apibara.

## The protocol

The client starts by calling the `StreamData` method in the `Stream` gRPC
service. The client must send a `StreamDataRequest` message to the server to
start the stream.

The request includes:

- `stream_id`: unique id for the stream. All messages generated in response to
  this request will have the specified stream id, or 0 if not specified.
- `starting_cursor`: specifies from where to start the stream. The cursor is
  stream-specific.
- `finality`: specifies the finality required by the client. This parameter
  changes the behavior of the stream.
- `filter`: specifies what type of data the client wants to receive. This is
  specific to each stream.

After the client requests data, the stream will start sending
`StreamDataResponse` messages to the client. The messages can have the
following content:

- `invalidate`: invalidates data previously sent, for example in response to
  chain reorganizations.
- `data`: sends a new batch of data.
- `heartbeat`: periodically sent if no other types of messages were produced.
  Used to confirm that the client and server are still connected.

The following diagram shows how the client starts receiving a stream of
`StreamDataResponse` messages after the initial `StreamDataRequest`.

      │      StreamDataRequest(stream_id=0)      │

      │                                          │ │o
    │ │     StreamDataResponse(stream_id=0)      │  p
      │◀─────────────────────────────────────────│ │
    └ ┼ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─│─
      │                                          │
      │                                          │

```

The client can reset the stream by sending a new `StreamDataRequest`. The server
will stop sending data for the previous request and will start sending data for
the new stream. Notice that because the flow is async, the client may still
receive messages from the old stream definition. Use the `stream_id` to uniquely
identify streams.

### Immutable stream

The `StreamData` RPC method requires a bidirectional gRPC stream between the
client and the server. Bidirectional streams are harder to use and in general
not as well supported by gRPC libraries, for this reason we provide a
`StreamDataImmutable` method that implements unidirectional streaming from
server to client.

### Data finality

The DNA protocol supports streaming data with different finality. The stream
behaves differently based on the finality mode specified in the request:

- `finalized`: the stream sends `data` messages for finalized data only. The
  `data` messages contain the data requested in the stream filter. Notice that
  there cannot be `invalidate` messages in this type of stream.
- `accepted`: the stream sends `data` messages for accepted data (including
  historical finalized data).
- `pending`: the stream sends `data` messages for pending data and for accepted
  data. Notice that the client may receive the same pending data multiple times.

### Cursor

Cursors are used to identify a location in a stream. The `end_cursor` in `Data`
messages refers to the location of the latest piece of data in the stream. When
clients send this cursor as a `starting_cursor` in a request, the server will
resume streaming by sending the first message that _follows_ the provided
cursor. When no `starting_cursor` is specified, the stream will start from the
genesis block. If the data in or before `end_cursor` was invalidated (following
a chain reorganization), the server will inform the client of it and will resume
the stream from the new stream's head.

A `Cursor` is made of two components:

- `order_key`: this is the sequence number for messages,
- `unique_key`: this is used to discriminate between data generated from
  different blocks at the same height.

## Protobuf specification

This section includes the `stream.proto` file containing the specification of
the `Stream` gRPC service.

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package apibara.node.v1alpha2;

service Stream {
  // Stream data from the node (bi-directional).
  rpc StreamData(stream StreamDataRequest) returns (stream StreamDataResponse);
  // Stream data from the node.
  rpc StreamDataImmutable(StreamDataRequest)
      returns (stream StreamDataResponse);
  // Get DNA service status.
  rpc Status(StatusRequest) returns (StatusResponse);
}

// Request data to be streamed.
message StreamDataRequest {
  // Used by the client to uniquely identify a stream.
  // All streams use `stream_id = 0` by default.
  optional uint64 stream_id = 1;
  // How many items to send in a single response.
  optional uint64 batch_size = 2;
  // Start streaming from the provided cursor.
  Cursor starting_cursor = 3;
  // Return data with the specified finality.
  // If not specified, defaults to `DATA_STATUS_ACCEPTED`.
  optional DataFinality finality = 4;
  // Return data according to the stream-specific filter.
  bytes filter = 5;
  // Combine multiple filters in the same stream.
  repeated bytes multi_filter = 6;
}

// Contains the data requested from the client.
message StreamDataResponse {
  // The stream id.
  uint64 stream_id = 1;
  oneof message {
    Invalidate invalidate = 2;
    Data data = 3;
    Heartbeat heartbeat = 4;
  }
}

// A cursor over the stream content.
message Cursor {
  // Key used for ordering messages in the stream.
  uint64 order_key = 1;
  // Key used to discriminate branches in the stream.
  bytes unique_key = 2;
}

// Data finality.
enum DataFinality {
  DATA_STATUS_UNKNOWN = 0;
  // Data was received, but is not part of the canonical chain yet.
  DATA_STATUS_PENDING = 1;
  // Data is now part of the canonical chain, but could still be invalidated.
  DATA_STATUS_ACCEPTED = 2;
  // Data is finalized and cannot be invalidated.
  DATA_STATUS_FINALIZED = 3;
}

// Invalidate data after the given cursor.
message Invalidate {
  // The cursor of the message before the now invalid data.
  Cursor cursor = 1;
}

// A batch of data.
message Data {
  // Cursor of the last item in the batch.
  Cursor end_cursor = 1;
  // The finality status of the data in the batch.
  DataFinality finality = 2;
  // The stream data.
  repeated bytes data = 3;
  // Cursor used to produced the batch.
  Cursor cursor = 4;
}

// Sent to clients to check if stream is still connected.
message Heartbeat {}

// Request for the `Status` method.
message StatusRequest {}

// Response for the `Status` method.
message StatusResponse {
  // The current head of the chain.
  Cursor current_head = 1;
  // The last cursor that was ingested by the node.
  Cursor last_ingested = 2;
}
```
