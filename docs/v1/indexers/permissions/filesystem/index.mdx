# How to access the filesystem

This guide shows you how to access the filesystem from Apibara indexers. After
reading this guide, you'll be able to use the [Deno filesystem
API](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/api/runtime-fs) from within your indexer.

## Reading files

Consider the following indexer that reads a list of smart contract addresses
from a file.

```ts [indexer.ts]
const addresses = await Deno.readTextFile("/path/to/file.txt");
console.log(addresses);

export const config = {
  streamUrl: "https://sepolia.starknet.a5a.ch",
  startingBlock: 10_000,
  network: "starknet",
  filter: {
    header: { weak: false },
  },
  sinkType: "console",
  sinkOptions: {},
};

export default async function transform(_block) {
  return [];
}
```

If you run it you will get the following error.

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
apibara run indexer.ts -A dna_xxx
```

```
sink configuration error
├╴at /dna/sinks/sink-common/src/error.rs:142:14
├╴failed to load configuration from script

╰─▶ indexer script operation failed

          at Object.readTextFile (ext:deno_fs/30_fs.js:751:29)
          at file:///path/to/indexer.ts:1:30
```

:::

You can grant access to the file with the `--allow-read` flag. Without
arguments, the flag grants access to any directory and file. You can restrict
access with a comma-separated list of files and directories.

## Writing files

The Apibara CLI provides write access to the filesystem using the `--allow-write` flag.
This flag works exactly the same as the read flag.
