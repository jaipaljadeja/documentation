# Setup your code editor for Apibara indexers

Apibara indexers are powered by [the Deno Javascript
runtime](https://deno.com/). If you haven't used Deno before, you need to setup
your environment to get the best possible developer experience for Apibara
indexers.

- [Install the Deno runtime and cli](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/).
- [Setup your code editor/IDE](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/setup_your_environment).

## Monorepo with Node, Bun and Deno

If you're using a monorepo you want to enable Deno only for your indexer's
project. You do that by customizing your editor's LSP configuration.

Let's start with the following monorepo with two sub-projects: the frontend
(for example Next.js) and the indexers.

```txt
.
├── apps
│   ├── frontend
│   │   ├── app
│   │   │   ├── layout.tsx
│   │   │   └── page.tsx
│   │   ├── package.json
│   │   └── tsconfig.json
│   └── indexers
│       ├── deno.json
│       └── src
│           └── my-indexer.ts
├── package.json
└── turbo.json
```

If you're using VS Code, you can enable Deno for the `indexers` project only by
adding the following configuration to `.vscode/settings.json`.

```json [.vscode/settings.json]
{
  "deno.enable": true,
  "deno.lint": true,
  "deno.unstable": false,
  "deno.enablePaths": ["./apps/indexers"]
}
```

After that, you may have to restart the Deno LSP server and you will have
autocompletion working in your indexers project.
