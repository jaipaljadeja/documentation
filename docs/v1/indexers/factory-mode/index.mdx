# How to use factory mode

In some cases, developers don't know which smart contracts they need to index in
advance. This is the case if the smart contracts are deployed by other smart
contracts (the factory pattern). Apibara provides a mechanism to update the data
filters at runtime, in response to onchain events.

## Enabling factory mode

Enable factory mode by exporting a `factory` function from your indexer.

```ts [indexer.ts]
export function factory(block) {
  // factory handler here.
}
```

Notice that this changes the indexer behavior the following way:

- `config.filter` specifies what data is streamed into the `factory` function.
- the `factory` function is responsible for updating the main data stream filter.
- the default `transform` function is invoked with data from the main data stream.

The following diagram show how data flows in an indexer that uses factory mode.
It is important to know that the factory and main data streams are synced, that is
the `factory` function will never be invoked with a block older than the most
recently invoked transform function.

```txt
      config.filter

            │   ┌────────────┐                ┌────────────┐
            ◎──▶│  factory   │───────────────▶│  factory   │─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─

 data stream           │                             │
                       │                             │
                       │                             │
                       │       ┌────────────┐        │         ┌────────────┐
                       ◎──────▶│ transform  │────────◎────────▶│ transform  │─ ─
             start main        └────────────┘    merge new     └────────────┘
             data stream                        filter with
                                               previous and
                                                 reconnect
```

## Implementing the factory function

The factory function is used to build the main stream data filter. The function
is invoked with the data filtered by `config.filter` and should return a new
(optional) filter and some (optional) data passed to the downstream integration.

Filters returned by subsequent invocations of the factory are merged together.

```ts [indexer.ts]
export function factory(block) {
  const filter = {
    header: { weak: true },
    // Build event filters based on the events in the current block.
    events: filterDeployedContracts(block),
  };
  // Store deployed contracts in the integration.
  const data = deployedContractsInfo(block);

  return {
    filter,
    data,
  };
}
```
