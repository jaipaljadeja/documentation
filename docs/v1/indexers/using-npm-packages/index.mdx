# Using NPM packages

Apibara indexers are powered by the Deno Javascript runtime, this makes them
incredibly fast and self-contained.

Indexers dependencies are loaded from external CDNs like:

- [ESM.sh](https://esm.sh/). This is the recommended choice.
- [JsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/).

You can read more about managing dependencies on [the official Deno
documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/tutorials/manage_dependencies).

## Examples

The following script loads common utilities from Starknet.js and Viem.

```ts [indexer.ts]
import { hash, uint256 } from "https://esm.run/starknet@5.14";
import { formatUnits } from "https://esm.run/viem@1.4";
```
