# Upgrading from v1

This guide explains how to upgrade your Starknet indexers from the old Apibara
CLI experience to the new Apibara v2 experience.

At the time of writing (March 2025), Apibara v2 is still in beta. This means
that it's ready for developers to start testing it, but you should not use it in
production yet.

## Main changes

- The underlying gRPC protocol and data types have changed. You can review all
  the changes [on this page](/docs/networks/starknet/upgrade-from-v1).
- The old CLI has been replaced by a pure Typescript library. This means you
  can now leverage the full Node ecosystem (including Bun and Deno).
- You can now extend indexers with [plugins and hooks](/docs/getting-started/plugins).

## Missing (but planned) features

These features will be added before the final DNA v2 release:

- Add missing integrations like MongoDB.

## Migration

For this guide, we'll assume an indexer like the following:

```ts [indexer.ts]
export const config = {
  streamUrl: "https://mainnet.starknet.a5a.ch",
  startingBlock: 800_000,
  network: "starknet",
  finality: "DATA_STATUS_ACCEPTED",
  filter: {
    header: {},
  },
  sinkType: "console",
  sinkOptions: {},
};

export default function transform(block) {
  return block;
}
```

### Step 1: initialize the Node project

Initialize the project to contain a `package.json` file:

```bash [Terminal]
npm init -y
```

Create the `indexers/` folder where all the indexers will live:

```bash [Terminal]
mkdir indexers
```

Add the dependencies needed to run the indexer. If you're using any external
dependencies, make sure to add them.

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
npm add --save apibara@next @apibara/protocol@next @apibara/indexer@next @apibara/starknet@next
```

```

  run `npm fund` for details

```

:::

### Step 2: initialize the Apibara project

Create a new file called `apibara.config.ts` in the root of your project.

```ts [apibara.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "apibara/config";

export default defineConfig({});
```

### Step 3: update the indexer

Now it's time to update the indexer.

- Move the indexer to the `indexers/` folder, ensuring tha the file name ends
  with `.indexer.ts`.
- Wrap the indexer in a `defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({ /* ... */ })` call.
  Notice that now the stream configuration and transform function live in the same
  configuration object.
- `startingBlock` is now a `BigInt`.
- `streamUrl` is the same, but the URL is different while in beta.
- `finality` is now simpler to type.
- The `filter` object changed. Please refer to the [filter documentation](/docs/networks/starknet/filter) for more information.
- `sinkType` and `sinkOptions` are gone.
- The `transform` function now takes named arguments, with `block` containing the block data.

The following `git diff` shows the changes to the indexer at the beginning of the guide.

+        const logger = useLogger();
+        logger.info(block);
+    },
+});
\ No newline at end of file
```

### Step 4: writing data

In version 1, the indexer would write data returned by `transform` to a sink.
Now, you use plugins to write data to databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

Refer to the plugins documentation for more information.
