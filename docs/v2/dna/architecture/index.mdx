# DNA architecture - V2 preview

This page describes in detail the architecture of the DNA v2 service.

At a high-level, the goals for DNA v2 are:

- serve onchain data through a protocol that's optimized for building indexers.
- provide a scalable and cost-efficient way to access onchain data.
- decouple compute from storage.

This is achieved by building a _cloud native_ service that ingests onchain data
from an archive node and stores it into Object Storage (e.g. Amazon S3,
Cloudflare R2). Data is served by stateless workers that read and filter data
from Object Storage before sending it to the indexers. The diagram below shows
all the high-level components that make a production deployment of DNA v2.

## DNA service

The DNA service is comprised of two components:

- ingestion service: listens for new blocks on the network and stores them into
  Object Storage.
- stream service: receives streaming requests from clients (indexers) and serves
  onchain data by filtering objects stored on S3.

### Ingestion service

The ingestion service is responsible for ingesting onchain data into a format
that's optimized for streaming.
In practice this means:

- splitting blocks into smaller pieces (headers, transactions, etc.).
- grouping data from contiguous blocks together into _segments_.
- building indices for quickly scanning through data.

The _"Storage layout"_ section goes into more details on how data is stored in
Object Storage.

Notice that the ingestion service only uploads finalized (immutable) data to
Object Storage, this presents a challenge since we want to serve data up to the
chain's head to clients.
For this reason, the ingestion service exposes an internal gRPC service that
stream services can use to receive blocks that have been ingested but are not
finalized yet. This service is also responsible for other bookkeeping operations,
such us updates to the ingestion state and notifying about chain reorganizations.

A final note about the ingestion service: a production deployment only needs
a single instance of this service. Because state is stored in Object Storage
and in the archive node, this service can be made stateless.

### Stream service

The stream service serves onchain data to clients. The raw onchain data stored
in Object Storage is filtered by the stream service before being sent over the
network, this results in lower egress fees compared to solutions that filter
data on the client.

In practice, when the streaming service needs to process a block segment it
looks for the data in a local cache before fetching it from Object Storage.
Operators can tweak the size of the cache to balance performance and cost.
The service design follows a _"cloud native"_ approach, where expensive and slow
network volumes are replaced by cheap and fast temporary volumes. In this case,
temporary volumes work because the cache doesn't need to be persisted between
restarts or deployments.

The following table, inspired [by the table in this article by
Vantage](https://www.vantage.sh/blog/ebs-vs-nvme-pricing-performance), shows the
difference in performance and price between an AWS EC2 instance using
(temporary) NVMe disks and two using EBS (one with a general purpose `gp3`
volume, and one with higher performance `io1` volume). All prices as of April
2024, US East, 1 year reserved with no upfront payment.

| Metric                | EBS (gp3)   | EBS (io1)   | NVMe              |

| Instance Type         | r6i.8xlarge | r6i.8xlarge | i4i.8xlarge       |

| Memory (GiB)          | 256         | 256         | 245               |
| Network (Gibps)       | 12.50       | 12.50       | 18.75             |
| Storage (GiB)         | 7500        | 7500        | 2x3750            |
| IOPS (read/write)     | 16,000      | 40,000      | 800,000 / 440,000 |
| Cost - Compute ($/mo) | 973         | 973         | 1,300             |
| Cost - Storage ($/mo) | 665         | 3,537       | 0                 |
| Cost - Total ($/mo)   | 1,638       | 4,510       | 1,300             |

Notice how the NVMe instance has 30-50x the IOPS per dollar. This price
difference means that Apibara users benefit from lower costs and/or higher
performance.

## Storage layout

This section describes how the DNA service stores data on S3. All data is stored
compressed using zstandard since it strikes a good balance between performance
and compression.

First, blocks are decomposed in smaller pieces (header, transactions, logs, and receipts).
Since the indexing speed is a function of the amount of data that needs to be
scanned, by splitting blocks into their smaller components we can improve
performance for clients that only need selected pieces of data (e.g. only logs).

After enough blocks have been processed, they are grouped together into
_"segments"_. Since there are four piece of data for each block, there will be
four files per segment. The size of the segment is configurable, the optimal
size in dependent on the network being ingested. All segments are stored under
the `segment/` prefix. Notice that segments only contain data about finalized
blocks.

Finally, the ingestion service creates indices to quickly lookup data into
segments without scanning the segments themselves. Indices are created at
regular block intervals (also configurable) and are stored under the `group/`
prefix. Once the stream server reaches a segment/block that doesn't belong to a
group, its content is sequentially scanned.
