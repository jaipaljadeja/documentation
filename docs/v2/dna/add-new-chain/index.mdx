# Adding a new chain

This page explains how to add support for a new chain to the DNA protocol. It's recommended that you're familiar with the high-level [DNA architecture](/docs/v2/dna/architecture) and the [DNA streaming protocol](/docs/v2/dna/streaming-protocol) before reading this page.

## Overview

Adding a new chain is relatively straightforward. Most of the code you need to write is describing the type of data stored on your chain.
The guide is split in the following sections:

 - **gRPC Protocol**: describes how to augment the gRPC protocol with filters and data types specific to the new chain.
 - **Storage**: describes how data is stored on disk and S3. 
 - **Data filtering**: describes how to filter data based on the client's request.

## gRPC Protocol

The first step is to define the root `Filter` and `Block` protobuf messages.

There are a few hard requirements on the messages:

 - The `header` field of the block must have tag `1`.
 - All other fields can have any tag.
 - Add one message type for each chain's resource (transactions, receipts, logs, etc.).
 - Each resource must have a `filter_ids` field with tag `1`.
 - Add a `Filter.id: uint32` property. Indexers use this to know which filters matched a specific piece of data and is used to populate the `filter_ids` field.

The following items are optional:

 - Add an option to the `Filter` to request all block headers. Users use this to debug their indexer.
 - Think how users are going to use the data. For example, developers often access the transaction's hash of a log, for this reason we include the transaction hash in the `Log` message.
 - Avoid excessive nesting of messages.

## Storage

The goal of the ingestion service is to fetch data from the chain (using the chain's RPC protocol), preprocess and index it, and then store it into the object storage.

DNA stores block data as pre-serialized protobuf messages. This is done to send data to clients by 
copying bytes directly, without expensive serialization and deserialization.

Since DNA doesn't know about the chain, it needs a way to filter data without scanning the entire block.
This is done with _indices_.

The chain-specific ingestion service is responsible for creating these indices. The next section goes into
detail how indices work, the important part is that:

 - Indices are grouped by the type of data they index (for example transactions, logs, and traces).
 - For each type of data, there can be multiple indices.
 - Indices point to one or more pre-serialized protobuf messages.

## Data filtering

As mentioned in the previous section, the DNA server uses indices to lookup data without scanning the entire block.
This is done by compiling the protobuf filter sent by the client into a special representation.
This `Filter` specifies:

 - What resource to filter (for example transactions, logs, and traces).
 - The list of conditions to match.

A _condition_ is a tuple with the filter id and the lookup key.
