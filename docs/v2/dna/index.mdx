# DNA protocol & architecture

This section describes the internals of DNA v2.

- [Wire protocol](/docs/dna/protocol): describes the gRPC streaming
  protocol. This page is useful if you're connecting directly to the stream or
  are adding support for a new programming language.
- [Architecture](/docs/dna/architecture): describes the high-level components of DNA v2.
- [Adding a new chain](/docs/dna/add-new-chain): describes what you
  need to do to bring DNA to a new chain. It digs deeper into anything
  chain-specific like storage and filters.
