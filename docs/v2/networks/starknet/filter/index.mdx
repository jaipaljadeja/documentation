This page contains reference about the available data filters for Starknet DNA
streams.

## Typescript types

```ts
import type {
  Block,
  FieldElement,
  Filter,
} from "https://esm.sh/@apibara/indexer/starknet";
```

## Field elements

Apibara represents Starknet field elements as hex-encode strings.

```ts
export type FieldElement = `0x${string}`;
```

## Filter types

### Root

```ts
export type Filter = {
  /** Header information. */
  header?: HeaderFilter;
  /** Include transactions. */
  transactions?: TransactionFilter[];
  /** Include events. */
  events?: EventFilter[];
  /** Include messages from L2 to L1. */
  messages?: L2ToL1MessageFilter[];
  /** Include state updates. */
  stateUpdate?: StateUpdateFilter;
};
```

### Header

Block headers contain information about the block being processed. The `weak`
flag is used to receive headers only if any other filter matches, this way your
indexer won't have to process empty blocks.

```ts
export type HeaderFilter = {
  /* If true, only include headers if any other filter matches. */
  weak?: boolean;
};
```

### Events

Events are the most common filter used by Apibara users. You can filter by smart contract or event selector.

- Compute the selector by computing the hash of the event name. That will be the first element of your `keys`.
- If you need multiple event types (e.g. `Approve` and `Transfer`), simply add more event filters to `filter.events`.
- Set `includeReceipt: false` to speed up indexing significantly.

**Common patterns**

- All events from a specific smart contract.

```ts
const filter = {
  events: [{ fromAddress: MY_CONTRACT, includeReceipt: false }],
};
```

- Multiple events from the same smart contract.

```ts
const filter = {
  events: [
    {
      fromAddress: MY_CONTRACT,
      keys: [APPROVE_SELECTOR],
      includeReceipt: false,
    },
    {
      fromAddress: MY_CONTRACT,
      keys: [TRANSFER_SELECTOR],
      includeReceipt: false,
    },
  ],
};
```

- Multiple events from different smart contracts.

```ts
const filter = {
  events: [
    {
      fromAddress: CONTRACT_A,
      keys: [TRANSFER_SELECTOR],
      includeReceipt: false,
    },
    {
      fromAddress: CONTRACT_B,
      keys: [TRANSFER_SELECTOR],
      includeReceipt: false,
    },
    {
      fromAddress: CONTRACT_C,
      keys: [TRANSFER_SELECTOR],
      includeReceipt: false,
    },
  ],
};
```

The full `EventFilter` type is the following.

```ts
export type EventFilter = {
  /** Filter by contract address. */
  fromAddress?: FieldElement;
  /** Filter by event keys (selector). */
  keys?: FieldElement[];
  /** Filter by event data. */
  data?: FieldElement[];
  /** Include events from reverted transactions. */
  includeReverted?: boolean;
  /** Include the transaction that emitted the event. Defaults to true. */
  includeTransaction?: boolean;
  /** Include the receipt of the transaction that emitted the event. Defaults to true. */
  includeReceipt?: boolean;
};
```

### Transactions

Transactions on Starknet can be of different type (invoke, declare contract, deploy contract or account, handle L1 message).

**Common patterns**

- Request all transactions in a block. Notice the empty transaction filter object, this filter will match _any_ transaction.

```ts
const filter = { transactions: [{}] };
```

- Request all transactions of a specific type, e.g. deploy account. In this case we specify the `deployAccount` variant.

```ts
const filter = { transactions: [{ deployAccount: {} }] };
```

The type definitions for `TransactionFilter` are:

```ts
export type TransactionFilterCommon = {
  /** Include reverted transactions. */
  includeReverted?: boolean;
};

export type InvokeTransactionV0Filter = {
  invokeV0?: {
    /** Filter by contract address. */
    contractAddress?: FieldElement;
    /** Filter by function selector. */
    entryPointSelector?: FieldElement;
    /** Filter by function arguments. */
    calldata?: FieldElement[];
  };
  invokeV1?: never;
  deploy?: never;
  declare?: never;
  l1Handler?: never;
  deployAccount?: never;
};

export type InvokeTransactionV1Filter = {
  invokeV1?: {
    /** Filter by sender address. */
    senderAddress?: FieldElement;
    /** Filter by function arguments. */
    calldata?: FieldElement[];
  };
  invokeV0?: never;
  deploy?: never;
  declare?: never;
  l1Handler?: never;
  deployAccount?: never;
};

export type DeployTransactionFilter = {
  deploy?: {
    /** Filter by contract address salt. */
    contractAddressSalt?: FieldElement;
    /** Filter by class hash. */
    classHash?: FieldElement;
    /** Filter by constructor arguments. */
    constructorCalldata?: FieldElement[];
  };
  invokeV0?: never;
  invokeV1?: never;
  declare?: never;
  l1Handler?: never;
  deployAccount?: never;
};

export type DeclareTransactionFilter = {
  declare?: {
    /** Filter by class hash. */
    classHash?: FieldElement;
    /** Filter by sender address. */
    senderAddress?: FieldElement;
  };
  invokeV0?: never;
  invokeV1?: never;
  deploy?: never;
  l1Handler?: never;
  deployAccount?: never;
};

export type L1HandlerTransactionFilter = {
  l1Handler?: {
    /** Filter by contract address. */
    contractAddress?: FieldElement;
    /** Filter by function selector. */
    entryPointSelector?: FieldElement;
    /** Filter by function arguments. */
    calldata?: FieldElement[];
  };
  invokeV0?: never;
  invokeV1?: never;
  deploy?: never;
  declare?: never;
  deployAccount?: never;
};

export type DeployAccountTransactionFilter = {
  deployAccount?: {
    /** Filter by contract address salt. */
    contractAddressSalt?: FieldElement;
    /** Filter by class hash. */
    classHash?: FieldElement;
    /** Filter by constructor arguments. */
    constructorCalldata?: FieldElement[];
  };
  invokeV0?: never;
  invokeV1?: never;
  deploy?: never;
  declare?: never;
  l1Handler?: never;
};

export type TransactionFilter = TransactionFilterCommon &
  (
    | InvokeTransactionV0Filter
    | InvokeTransactionV1Filter
    | DeployTransactionFilter
    | DeclareTransactionFilter
    | L1HandlerTransactionFilter
    | DeployAccountTransactionFilter
  );

export type EventFilter = {
  /** Filter by contract address. */
  fromAddress?: FieldElement;
  /** Filter by event keys (selector). */
  keys?: FieldElement[];
  /** Filter by event data. */
  data?: FieldElement[];
  /** Include events from reverted transactions. */
  includeReverted?: boolean;
  /** Include the transaction that emitted the event. Defaults to true. */
  includeTransaction?: boolean;
  /** Include the receipt of the transaction that emitted the event. Defaults to true. */
  includeReceipt?: boolean;
};
```

### Messages

Filter messages from L1 to Starknet.

```ts
export type L2ToL1MessageFilter = {
  /** Filter by destination address. */
  toAddress?: FieldElement;
  /** Filter by payload. */
  payload?: FieldElement[];
  /** Include messages from reverted transactions. */
  includeReverted?: boolean;
};
```

### State update

This filter returns data about updates to Starknet state. Developers usually use this filter to track changes to the storage variables (`storageDiffs`) or declared/deployed contracts.

```ts
export type StateUpdateFilter = {
  /** Filter storage diffs. */
  storageDiffs?: StorageDiffFilter[];
  /** Filter declared contracts. */
  declaredContracts?: DeclaredContractFilter[];
  /** Filter deployed contracts. */
  deployedContracts?: DeployedContractFilter[];
  /** Filter nonce updates. */
  nonces?: NonceUpdateFilter[];
  /** Filter declared classes. */
  declaredClasses?: DeclaredClassFilter[];
  /** Filter replaced classes. */
  replacedClasses?: ReplacedClassFilter[];
};

export type StorageDiffFilter = {
  /** Filter by contract address. */
  contractAddress?: FieldElement;
};

export type DeclaredContractFilter = {
  /** Filter by class hash. */
  classHash?: FieldElement;
};

export type DeployedContractFilter = {
  /** Filter by contract address. */
  contractAddress?: FieldElement;
  /** Filter by class hash. */
  classHash?: FieldElement;
};

export type NonceUpdateFilter = {
  /** Filter by contract address. */
  contractAddress?: FieldElement;
  /** Filter by nonce value. */
  nonce?: FieldElement;
};

export type DeclaredClassFilter = {
  /** Filter by class hash. */
  classHash?: FieldElement;
  /** Filter by compiled class hash. */
  compiledClassHash?: FieldElement;
};

export type ReplacedClassFilter = {
  /** Filter by contract address. */
  contractAddress?: FieldElement;
  /** Filter by class hash. */
  classHash?: FieldElement;
};
```
