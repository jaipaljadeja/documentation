# Starknet filter reference

This page contains reference about the available data filters for Starknet DNA
streams.

### Related pages

- [Starknet block data reference](/docs/networks/starknet/data)

## Filter ID

All filters have an associated ID. When the server filters a block, it will
return a list of all filters that matched a piece of data with the data.
You can use this ID to build powerful abstractions in your indexers.

## Field elements

Apibara represents Starknet field elements as hex-encode strings.

```ts
export type FieldElement = `0x${string}`;
```

## Filter types

### Root

The root filter object contains a collection of filters.
Notice that providing an empty filter object is an error.

```ts
export type Filter = {
  header?: HeaderFilter;
  transactions?: TransactionFilter[];
  events?: EventFilter[];
  messages?: MessageToL1Filter[];
  storageDiffs?: StorageDiffFilter[];
  contractChanges?: ContractChangeFilter[];
  nonceUpdates?: NonceUpdateFilter[];
};
```

### Header

The `HeaderFilter` object controls when the block header is returned to the client.

```ts
export type HeaderFilter = "always" | "on_data" | "on_data_or_on_new_block";
```

The values have the following meaning:

- `always`: Always return the header, even if no other filter matches.
- `on_data`: Return the header only if any other filter matches. This is the default value.
- `on_data_or_on_new_block`: Return the header only if any other filter matches. If no other filter matches, return the header only if the block is a new block.

### Events

Events are the most common filter used by Apibara users. You can filter by smart contract or event selector.

```ts
export type EventFilter = {
  id?: number;
  address?: FieldElement;
  keys?: (FieldElement | null)[];
  strict?: boolean;
  transactionStatus?: "succeeded" | "reverted" | "all";
  includeTransaction?: boolean;
  includeReceipt?: boolean;
  includeMessages?: boolean;
  includeSiblings?: boolean;
};
```

**Properties**

- `address`: filter by contract address. If empty, matches any contract
  address.
- `keys`: filter by keys. Use `null` to match _any_ value. The server will
  filter based only the first four elements of the array.
- `strict`: return events whose keys length matches the filter. By default, the
  filter does a prefix match on the keys.
- `transactionStatus`: return events emitted by transactions with the provided
  status. Defaults to `succeeded`.
- `includeTransaction`: also return the transaction that emitted the event.
- `includeReceipt`: also return the receipt of the transaction that emitted the
  event.
- `includeMessages`: also return all messages to L1 sent by the transaction that
  emitted the event.
- `includeSiblings`: also return all other events emitted by the same transaction
  that emitted the matched event.

**Examples**

- All events from a specific smart contract.

```ts
const filter = {
  events: [{ address: MY_CONTRACT }],
};
```

- Multiple events from the same smart contract.

```ts
const filter = {
  events: [
    {
      address: MY_CONTRACT,
      keys: [getSelector("Approve")],
    },
    {
      address: MY_CONTRACT,
      keys: [getSelector("Transfer")],
    },
  ],
};
```

- Multiple events from different smart contracts.

```ts
const filter = {
  events: [
    {
      address: CONTRACT_A,
      keys: [getSelector("Transfer")],
    },
    {
      address: CONTRACT_B,
      keys: [getSelector("Transfer")],
      includeReceipt: false,
    },
    {
      address: CONTRACT_C,
      keys: [getSelector("Transfer")],
    },
  ],
};
```

- All `Transfer` events, from any contract.

```ts
const filter = {
  events: [
    {
      keys: [getSelector("Transfer")],
    },
  ],
};
```

- All "new type" `Transfer` events with indexed sender and destination addresses.

```ts
const filter = {
  events: [
    {
      keys: [getSelector("Transfer"), null, null],
      strict: true,
    },
  ],
};
```

### Transactions

Transactions on Starknet can be of different type (invoke, declare contract, deploy contract or account, handle L1 message). Clients can request all transactions or filter by transaction type.

```ts
export type InvokeTransactionV0Filter = {
  _tag: "invokeV0";
  invokeV0: {};
};

export type InvokeTransactionV1Filter = {
  _tag: "invokeV1";
  invokeV1: {};
};

export type InvokeTransactionV3Filter = {
  _tag: "invokeV3";
  invokeV3: {};
};

export type DeployTransactionFilter = {
  _tag: "deploy";
  deploy: {};
};

export type DeclareV0TransactionFilter = {
  _tag: "declareV0";
  declareV0: {};
};

export type DeclareV1TransactionFilter = {
  _tag: "declareV1";
  declareV1: {};
};

export type DeclareV2TransactionFilter = {
  _tag: "declareV2";
  declareV2: {};
};

export type DeclareV3TransactionFilter = {
  _tag: "declareV3";
  declareV3: {};
};

export type L1HandlerTransactionFilter = {
  _tag: "l1Handler";
  l1Handler: {};
};

export type DeployAccountV1TransactionFilter = {
  _tag: "deployAccountV1";
  deployAccountV1: {};
};

export type DeployAccountV3TransactionFilter = {
  _tag: "deployAccountV3";
  deployAccountV3: {};
};

export type TransactionFilter = {
  id?: number;
  transactionStatus?: "succeeded" | "reverted" | "all";
  includeReceipt?: boolean;
  includeMessages?: boolean;
  includeEvents?: boolean;
  transactionType?:
    | InvokeTransactionV0Filter
    | InvokeTransactionV1Filter
    | InvokeTransactionV3Filter
    | DeployTransactionFilter
    | DeclareV0TransactionFilter
    | DeclareV1TransactionFilter
    | DeclareV2TransactionFilter
    | DeclareV3TransactionFilter
    | L1HandlerTransactionFilter
    | DeployAccountV1TransactionFilter
    | DeployAccountV3TransactionFilter;
};
```

**Properties**

- `transactionStatus`: return transactions with the provided status. Defaults to
  `succeeded`.
- `includeReceipt`: also return the receipt of the transaction.
- `includeMessages`: also return the messages to L1 sent by the transaction.
- `includeEvents`: also return the events emitted by the transaction.
- `transactionType`: filter by transaction type.

**Examples**

- Request all transactions in a block. Notice the empty transaction filter object, this filter will match _any_ transaction.

```ts
const filter = { transactions: [{}] };
```

- Request all transactions of a specific type, e.g. deploy account. In this case we specify the `deployAccountV3` variant.

```ts
const filter = {
  transactions: [
    {
      transactionType: { _tag: "deployAccountV3", deployAccountV3: {} },
    },
  ],
};
```

### Messages

Filter messages from L1 to Starknet.

```ts
export type MessageToL1Filter = {
  id?: number;
  fromAddress?: FieldElement;
  toAddress?: FieldElement;
  transactionStatus?: "succeeded" | "reverted" | "all";
  includeTransaction?: boolean;
  includeReceipt?: boolean;
  includeEvents?: boolean;
};
```

**Properties**

- `fromAddress`: filter by sender address. If empty, matches any sender address.
- `toAddress`: filter by receiver address. If empty, matches any receiver address.
- `transactionStatus`: return messages with the provided status. Defaults to
  `succeeded`.
- `includeTransaction`: also return the transaction that sent the message.
- `includeReceipt`: also return the receipt of the transaction that sent the
  message.
- `includeEvents`: also return the events emitted by the transaction that sent
  the message.

### Storage diff

Request changes to the storage of one or more contracts.

```ts
export type StorageDiffFilter = {
  id?: number;
  contractAddress?: FieldElement;
};
```

**Properties**

- `contractAddress`: filter by contract address. If empty, matches any contract
  address.

### Contract change

Request changes to the declared or deployed contracts.

```ts
export type DeclaredClassFilter = {
  _tag: "declaredClass";
  declaredClass: {};
};

export type ReplacedClassFilter = {
  _tag: "replacedClass";
  replacedClass: {};
};

export type DeployedContractFilter = {
  _tag: "deployedContract";
  deployedContract: {};
};

export type ContractChangeFilter = {
  id?: number;
  change?: DeclaredClassFilter | ReplacedClassFilter | DeployedContractFilter;
};
```

**Properties**

- `change`: filter by change type.
  - `declaredClass`: receive declared classes.
  - `replacedClass`: receive replaced classes.
  - `deployedContract`: receive deployed contracts.

### Nonce update

Request changes to the nonce of one or more contracts.

```ts
export type NonceUpdateFilter = {
  id?: number;
  contractAddress?: FieldElement;
};
```

**Properties**

- `contractAddress`: filter by contract address. If empty, matches any contract.
