# EVM data reference

This page contains reference about the available data in EVM DNA streams.

## Filter ID

All filters have an associated ID. To help clients correlate filters with data,
the filter ID is included in the `filterIds` field of all data objects.
This field contains the list of _all filter IDs_ that matched a piece of data.

## Nullable fields

**Important**: most fields are nullable to allow evolving the protocol. You should
always assert the presence of a field for critical indexers.

## Scalar types

The `@apibara/evm` package defines the following scalar types:

- `Address`: a 20-byte Ethereum address, represented as a `0x${string}` type.
- `B256`: a 32-byte Ethereum value, represented as a `0x${string}` type.
- `Bytes`: arbitrary length bytes, represented as a `0x${string}` type.

## Usage with viem

Most types are compatible with [viem](https://viem.sh/).
For example, you can decode logs with the following code:

```ts
import type { B256 } from "@apibara/evm";
import { decodeEventLog, parseAbi } from "viem";

const abi = parseAbi([
  "event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)",
]);

// Somewhere in your indexer...
for (const log of logs) {
  const { args, eventName } = decodeEventLog({
    abi,
    topics: log.topics as [B256, ...B256[]],
    data: log.data,
  });
}
```

## Data type

### Block

The root object is the `Block`.

```ts
export type Block = {
  header?: BlockHeader;
  logs: Log[];
  transactions: Transaction[];
  receipts: TransactionReceipt[];
  withdrawals: Withdrawal[];
};
```

### Header

This is the block header, which contains information about the block.

```ts
export type Bloom = Bytes;

export type BlockHeader = {
  blockNumber?: bigint;
  blockHash?: B256;
  parentBlockHash?: B256;
  unclesHash?: B256;
  miner?: Address;
  stateRoot?: B256;
  transactionsRoot?: B256;
  receiptsRoot?: B256;
  logsBloom?: Bloom;
  difficulty?: bigint;
  gasLimit?: bigint;
  gasUsed?: bigint;
  timestamp?: Date;
  extraData?: Bytes;
  mixHash?: B256;
  nonce?: bigint;
  baseFeePerGas?: bigint;
  withdrawalsRoot?: B256;
  totalDifficulty?: bigint;

  parentBeaconBlockRoot?: B256;
};
```

- `excessBlobGas`: the excess blob gas.
- `parentBeaconBlockRoot`: the parent beacon block root.

### Log

An EVM log. It comes together with the essential information about the transaction
that emitted the log.

```ts
export type Log = {
  filterIds: number[];
  address?: Address;
  topics: B256[];
  data: Bytes;
  logIndex: number;
  transactionIndex: number;
  transactionHash: B256;
  transactionStatus: "succeeded" | "reverted";
};
```

**Properties**

- `address`: the address of the contract that emitted the log.
- `topics`: the topics of the log.
- `data`: the data of the log.
- `logIndex`: the index of the log in the block.
- `transactionIndex`: the index of the transaction that emitted the log.
- `transactionHash`: the hash of the transaction that emitted the log.
