# EVM filter reference

This page contains reference about the available data filters for EVM DNA
streams.

## Filter ID

All filters have an associated ID. When the server filters a block, it will
return a list of all filters that matched a piece of data with the data.
You can use this ID to build powerful abstractions in your indexers.

## Usage with viem

Most types are compatible with [viem](https://viem.sh/).
For example, you can generate log filters with the following code:

```ts
import { encodeEventTopics, parseAbi } from "viem";

const abi = parseAbi([
  "event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)",
]);

const filter = {
  logs: [{
    topics: encodeEventTopics({
      abi,
      eventName: "Transfer",
      args: { from: null, to: null },
    }),
    strict: true,
  }]
}
```

## Filter types

### Root

The root filter object contains a collection of filters.
Notice that providing an empty filter object is an error.

```ts
export type Filter = {
  header?: HeaderFilter;
  logs?: LogFilter[];
  transactions?: TransactionFilter[];
  withdrawals?: WithdrawalFilter[];
};
```

### Header

The `HeaderFilter` object controls when the block header is returned to the client.

```ts
export type HeaderFilter = "always" | "on_data" | "on_data_or_on_new_block";
```

The values have the following meaning:

- `always`: Always return the header, even if no other filter matches.
- `on_data`: Return the header only if any other filter matches. This is the default value.
- `on_data_or_on_new_block`: Return the header only if any other filter matches. If no other filter matches, return the header only if the block is a new block.

## Logs

Logs are the most common type of DNA filters. Use this filter to get the logs and
their associated data like transactions, receipts, and sibling logs.

```ts
export type LogFilter = {
  id?: number;
  address?: `0x${string}`;
  topics?: (`0x${string} | null`)[];
  strict?: boolean;
  transactionStatus?: "succeeded" | "reverted" | "all";
  includeTransaction?: boolean;
  includeReceipt?: boolean;
  includeSiblings?: boolean;
};
```

**Properties**

 - `address`: filter by contract address. If empty, matches any contract
    address.
 - `topics`: filter by topic. Use `null` to match _any_ value.
 - `strict`: return logs whose topics length matches the filter. By default, the
    filter does a prefix match on the topics.
 - `transactionStatus`: return logs emitted by transactions with the provided
    status. Defaults to `succeeded`.
 - `includeTransaction`: also return the transaction that emitted the log.
 - `includeReceipt`: also return the receipt of the transaction that emitted the
    log.
 - `includeSiblings`: also return all other logs emitted by the same transaction
    that emitted the matched log.

**Examples**

 - All logs in a block emitted by successful transactions.

```ts
const filter = {
  logs: [{}],
};
```

 - All `Transfer` events emitted by successful transactions. Notice that this will
   match logs from ERC-20, ERC-721, and other contracts that emit `Transfer`.

```ts
const filter = {
  logs: [{
    topics: ["0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef"],
  }],
};
```

 - All `Transfer` events that follow the ERC-721 standard. Notice that this will
   not match logs from ERC-20 since the number of indexed parameters is different.

```ts
const filter = {
  logs: [{
    topics: [
        "0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef",
        null, // from
        null, // to
        null, // tokenId
    ],
    strict: true,
  }],
};
```

 - All logs emitted by `CONTRACT_A` OR `CONTRACT_B`.
 
```ts
const filter = {
  logs: [{
    address: CONTRACT_A,
  }, {
    address: CONTRACT_B,
  }],
};
```

## Transactions

Request Ethereum transactions.

```ts
export type TransactionFilter = {
  id?: number;
  from?: `0x${string}`;
  to?: `0x${string}`;
  create?: true,
  transactionStatus?: "succeeded" | "reverted" | "all";
  includeReceipt?: boolean;
  includeLogs?: boolean;
};
```

**Properties**

 - `from`: filter by sender address. If empty, matches any sender address.
 - `to`: filter by receiver address. If empty, matches any receiver address.
 - `create`: filter by whether the transaction is a create transaction.
 - `transactionStatus`: return transactions with the provided status. Defaults to
    `succeeded`.
 - `includeReceipt`: also return the receipt of the transaction.
 - `includeLogs`: also return the logs emitted by the transaction.

**Examples**

 - All transactions in a block.
 
```ts
const filter = {
  transactions: [{}],
};
```

 - All transactions from `0xAB...`.

```ts
const filter = {
  transactions: [{
    from: "0xAB...",
  }],
};
```

 - All create transactions.

```ts
const filter = {
  transactions: [{
    create: true,
  }],
};
```

## Withdrawals

Request Ethereum withdrawals.

```ts
export type WithdrawalFilter = {
  id?: number;
  validatorIndex?: number;
  address?: string;
};
```

**Properties**

 - `validatorIndex`: filter by validator's index. If empty, matches any
    validator's index.
 - `address`: filter by withdrawal address. If empty, matches any withdrawal
    address.

**Examples**

 - All withdrawals

```ts
const filter = {
  withdrawals: [{}],
};
```

 - All withdrawals from validator with index `1234`.

```ts
const filter = {
  withdrawals: [{
    validatorIndex: 1234,
  }],
};
```

 - All withdrawals from validators with index `1234` OR `7890`.

```ts
const filter = {
  withdrawals: [{
    validatorIndex: 1234,
  }, {
    validatorIndex: 7890,
  }],
};
```

 - All withdrawals to address `0xAB...`.

```ts
const filter = {
  withdrawals: [{
    address: "0xAB...",
  }],
};
```
