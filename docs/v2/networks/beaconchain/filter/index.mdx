# Beacon Chain filter reference

This page contains reference about the available data filters for Beacon Chain
DNA streams.

## Filter ID

All filters have an associated ID. When the server filters a block, it will
return a list of all filters that matched a piece of data with the data.
You can use this ID to build powerful abstractions in your indexers.

## Filter types

### Root

The root filter object contains a collection of filters.
Notice that providing an empty filter object is an error.

```ts
export type Filter = {
  header?: HeaderFilter;
  transactions: TransactionFilter[];
  blobs: BlobFilter[];
  validators: ValidatorFilter[];
};
```

### Header

The `HeaderFilter` object controls when the block header is returned to the client.

```ts
export type HeaderFilter = "always" | "on_data" | "on_data_or_on_new_block";
```

The values have the following meaning:

- `always`: Always return the header, even if no other filter matches.
- `on_data`: Return the header only if any other filter matches. This is the default value.
- `on_data_or_on_new_block`: Return the header only if any other filter matches. If no other filter matches, return the header only if the block is a new block.

### Transactions

DNA includes decoded transactions submitted to the network.

```ts
export type TransactionFilter = {
  id?: number;
  from?: `0x${string}`;
  to?: `0x${string}`;
  create?: boolean;
  includeBlob?: boolean;
};
```

**Properties**

- `from`: filter by sender address. If empty, matches any sender address.
- `to`: filter by receiver address. If empty, matches any receiver address.
- `create`: filter by whether the transaction is a create transaction.
- `includeBlob`: also return all blobs included in the transaction.

**Examples**

- All blobs included in a transaction to a specific contract.

```ts
const filter = [
  {
    transactions: [
      {
        to: "0xff00000000000000000000000000000000074248",
        includeBlob: true,
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

### Blobs

A blob and its content.

```ts
export type BlobFilter = {
  id?: number;
  includeTransaction?: boolean;
};
```

**Properties**

- `includeTransaction`: also return the transaction that included the blob.

**Examples**

- All blobs posted to the network together with the transaction that posted them.

```ts
const filter = [
  {
    blobs: [
      {
        includeTransaction: true,
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

### Validators

Validators and their historical balances.

```ts
export type ValidatorStatus =
  | "pending_initialized"
  | "pending_queued"
  | "active_ongoing"
  | "active_exiting"
  | "active_slashed"
  | "exited_unslashed"
  | "exited_slashed"
  | "withdrawal_possible"
  | "withdrawal_done";

export type ValidatorFilter = {
  id?: number;
  validatorIndex?: number;
  status?: ValidatorStatus;
};
```

**Properties**

- `validatorIndex`: filter by the validator index.
- `status`: filter by validator status.

**Examples**

- All validators that exited, both slashed and unlashed.

```ts
const filter = [
  {
    validators: [
      {
        status: "exited_unslashed",
      },
      {
        status: "exited_slashed",
      },
    ],
  },
];
```
