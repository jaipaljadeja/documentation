# Frequently Asked Questions

## Performance

### Why is indexing slower after I add the plugin?

There are many possible reasons for this, but the most common ones are:

- The latency between your indexer and the database is high.
- Your indexer is inserting rows too frequently.

In the first case, consider moving your indexer's deployment closer to the database to improve latency.

In the second case, consider using a bulk insert strategy to reduce the number of individual insert operations.
Usually, this means converting many `db.insert(..)` operations inside a loop into a single `db.insert()` call.

```ts
// Before
for (const event of block.events) {
  const transfer = decodeEvent(event);
  await db.insert(schema.transfers).values(transfer);
}

// After
const transfers = block.events.map((event) => decodeEvent(event));
await db.insert(schema.transfers).values(transfers);
```
