# Drizzle with PostgreSQL

The Apibara Indexer SDK supports Drizzle ORM for storing data to PostgreSQL.

## Installation

To use Drizzle with PostgreSQL, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash [Terminal]
npm install drizzle-orm pg
```

We reccomend using Drizzle Kit to manage the database schema.

```bash [Terminal]
npm install --save-dev drizzle-kit
```

## Schema configuration

Indexer's tables require storing data in a way that can handle chain reorgs. The
approach used by Apibara is to add an additional `_cursor` column that tracks
when the data was inserted or updated. This is handled transparently by the
`pgIndexerTable` function.

```ts [schema.ts]
import { pgIndexerTable } from "@apibara/indexer/sinks/drizzle";

export const transfers = pgIndexerTable("transfers", {
  amount: bigint("amount", { mode: "number" }),
  transactionHash: text("transaction_hash"),
});
```

When generating the database migrations with Drizzle Kit, you can see the extra `_cursor` column added to the table.

```sql [migrations/00000000000000_create_table.sql]
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "transfers" (
	"amount" bigint,
	"transaction_hash" text,
	"_cursor" "int8range" NOT NULL
);
```

## Writing and reading data from within the indexer

From within the indexer, use the `useSink` hook to access the current Drizzle database transaction.
Notice that all operations inside the `transform` function are executed inside the same transaction
to ensure that the data is inserted or updated atomically. The `db` object returned by the hook
provides the following methods:

 - `insert`: to insert new rows into the table.
 - `update`: to update existing rows in the table.
 - `delete`: to delete rows from the table.
 - `select`: to query the table.

All four methods work analogously to the `insert`, `update`, `delete`, and
`select` methods from the `drizzle-orm` package.

```ts [indexers/my-indexer.indexer.ts]
import pg from "pg";
import { defineIndexer, useSink } from "@apibara/indexer";
import { drizzle as drizzleSink } from "@apibara/indexer/sinks/drizzle";
import { StarknetStream } from "@apibara/starknet";

import * as schema, { transfers } from "@/lib/schema";

const connectionString = "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres";
const pool = new pg.Pool({ connectionString });
const db = drizzle(pool, { schema });

export default defineIndexer(StarknetStream)({
  streamUrl: "https://starknet.preview.apibara.org",
  finality: "accepted",
  startingCursor,
  filter,
  sink: drizzleSink({ database, tables: [transfers] }),
  async transform({ endCursor, block, context }) {
    const { db } = useSink({ context });
    const { events } = block;

    const values = events.map(decodeTransferEvent);
    await db.insert(transfers).values(values);
  },
});
```

## Querying data from outside the indexer

When selecting data from outside the indexer, you need to add the following
condition on `_cursor` to your query. This ensure that only data that has not been
removed or updated is returned by the query.

```sql
WHERE upper_inf(_cursor)
```

## Improving performance

You should always add an index on the `_cursor` column to improve the
performance of the queries.

## Cleaning up old data

Data that cannot be removed because of reorgs is automatically removed by the
indexer as it receives updates to the finalized block. Thanks to this, your database
contains the minimal amount of data required to safely handle reorgs.
