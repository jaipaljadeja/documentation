# Drizzle with PostgreSQL

The Apibara Indexer SDK supports Drizzle ORM for storing data to PostgreSQL.

## Installation

### Using the CLI

You can add an indexer that uses Drizzle for storage by selecting "PostgreSQL"
in the "Storage" section when creating an indexer.

The CLI automatically updates your `package.json` to add all necessary dependencies.

### Manually

To use Drizzle with PostgreSQL, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash [Terminal]
npm install drizzle-orm pg @apibara/plugin-drizzle@next
```

We recommend using Drizzle Kit to manage the database schema.

```bash [Terminal]
npm install --save-dev drizzle-kit
```

## Schema configuration

You can use the `pgTable` function from `drizzle-orm/pg-core` to define the schema,
no changes required.

The only important thing to notice is that your table must have an `id` column (name configurable)
that uniquely identifies each row. This requirement is necessary to handle chain reorganizations.
Read more how the plugin handles chain reorganizations[on the internals page](/docs/v2/storage/drizzle-pg/internals).

```ts [lib/schema.ts]
import { bigint, pgTable, text, uuid } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const transfers = pgTable("transfers", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey().defaultRandom(),
  amount: bigint("amount", { mode: "number" }),
  transactionHash: text("transaction_hash"),
});
```

## Adding the plugin to your indexer

Add the `drizzleStorage` plugin to your indexer's `plugins`:

```ts [my-indexer.indexer.ts]
import { drizzleStorage, useDrizzleStorage } from "@apibara/plugin-drizzle";

import { db } from "@/lib/db";

export default defineIndexer(EvmStream)({
  // ...
  plugins: [drizzleStorage({ db })],
  // ...
});
```

## Writing and reading data from within the indexer

Use the `useDrizzleStorage` hook to access the current database transaction.
This transaction behaves exactly like a regular Drizzle ORM transaction because
it is. Thanks to the way the plugin works and handles chain reorganizations, it
can expose the full Drizzle ORM API without any limitations.

```ts [my-indexer.indexer.ts]
export default defineIndexer(EvmStream)({
  // ...
  async transform({ endCursor, block, context, finality }) {
    const { db } = useDrizzleStorage();

    for (const event of block.events) {
      await db.insert(transfers).values(decodeEvent(event));
    }
  },
});
```

You are not limited to inserting data, you can also update and delete rows.

## Querying data from outside the indexer

You can query data from your application like you always do, using the standard Drizzle ORM library.

## Improving performance

You should always add an index on the `id` column. This column is used every time the indexer handles
a chain reorganization or a new pending block.
