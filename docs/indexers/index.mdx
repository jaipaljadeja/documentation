# Building indexers with Apibara

Apibara indexers perform three actions:

- **Stream** onchain data into your indexer, using DNA.
- **Transform** the data into a higher-level representation that maps to your application domain.
- **Integrate** data with the rest of your application by sending it to other services.

All three steps are controlled by an _indexer script_, that is a Javascript or Typescript file.

At minimum, a script needs to export the following:

- `config`: contains the stream and sink (integration) configuration.
- a default function used to transform raw onchain data.

Optionally, indexers can export a `factory` function to [enable factory
mode](/docs/v1/indexers/factory-mode). Factory mode changes the indexer behavior
and it's documented separately.

## Permissions

By default, Apibara indexers have no access to environment variables, network,
and the filesystem. This is done to protect your system from malicious
Javascript dependencies. [Refer to the permissions section to learn more about
it](/docs/v1/indexers/permissions).

## Configuration

The `config` object configures both the stream and the sink.

- `streamUrl`: the stream URL. Operators can override this field with the `--stream-url` CLI flag.
- `startingBlock`: start streaming data from this block.
- `network`: the network type, e.g. `starknet` to stream data from Starknet or a Starknet-based appchain.
- `finality`: data status finality. Can be one of `DATA_STATUS_PENDING`,
  `DATA_STATUS_ACCEPTED`, or `DATA_STATUS_FINALIZED`. Defaults to accepted.
- `filter`: the filter used to select onchain data. [Learn more about data filtering here](/docs/v1/indexers/filter).
- `sinkType`: send data to the specified sink plugin. See the "Integrations"
  section in the sidebar to see which sinks are available.
- `sinkOptions`: options used to configure the sink.

If you're using Typescript, you can make the `config` object type-safe by importing the appropriate types:

```ts [indexer.ts]
import type {
  Config,
  NetworkOptions,
  SinkOptions,
} from "https://esm.sh/@apibara/indexer";

export const config: Config<NetworkOptions, SinkOptions> = {
  streamUrl,
  // ...
};
```

You can also further restrict the network and sink options. In this case your
editor will provide autocompletion for the available `sinkOptions`.
Refer to the [editor setup page](/docs/v1/indexers/editor-setup) to learn how to
configure your editor for Apibara.

```ts [indexer.ts]
import type { Config, NetworkOptions } from "https://esm.sh/@apibara/indexer";
import type { Console } from "https://esm.sh/@apibara/indexer/sink/console";

export const config: Config<NetworkOptions, Console> = {
  streamUrl,
  // ...
  sinkType: "console",
  sinkOptions: {},
};
```

## Data transformation

All indexers must export a default function (usually called `transform`) that
accepts a single parameter and returns a JSON object passed to the downstream
integration.

```ts [indexer.ts]
export default function transform(block) {
  // Do something here.
  return data;
}
```

The transform function can be `async` in case you need to perform async
operations like network access ([read more about network access
here](/docs/v1/indexers/permissions/network)).

Notice that the value returned by the transform function **must be JSON-encodable**.
For web3 applications, this means you need to convert `BigInt` to either a
`number` or a `string` (recommended).
