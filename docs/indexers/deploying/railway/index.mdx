# Deploying to Railway

![Railway logo](logotype-light.png)

## Create a project Dockerfile

The first step is to create a `Dockerfile` for your project. If you're using a
[monorepo](/docs/indexers/editor-setup#monorepo-with-node-bun-and-deno), place
the `Dockerfile` in `apps/indexers`.

```dockerfile
FROM quay.io/apibara/sink-postgres:0.7.0-x86_64

WORKDIR /app
COPY ./src/* /app

ENTRYPOINT ["/nix/store/rh1g8pb7wfnyr527jfmkkc5lm3sa1f0l-apibara-sink-postgres-0.7.0/bin/apibara-sink-postgres"]
```

Notice that the base image is build from scratch (not an OS like Ubuntu), so the
binary is in a location that depends on the build. For this reason we stick to
a specific version and architecture.

When updating the image you also need to update the Docker `ENTRYPOINT`.

First pull the new version of the image.

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
docker image pull quay.io/apibara/sink-postgres:0.7.0-x86_64
```

```
2352c28bb4a7: Download complete
979824b603fa: Download complete
quay.io/apibara/sink-postgres:0.7.0-x86_64
```

:::

Then get the entrypoint path by inspecting the image.

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
docker image inspect quay.io/apibara/sink-postgres:0.7.0-x86_64 | jq '.[].Config.Entrypoint'
```

```
[
  "/nix/store/rh1g8pb7wfnyr527jfmkkc5lm3sa1f0l-apibara-sink-postgres-0.7.0/bin/apibara-sink-postgres"
]
```

:::

Save and push to GitHub.

## Create a new Railway service

From the Railway dashboard, create a new service deployment and connect your
GitHub repository.

- Change "root directory" to the folder containing your `Dockerfile`, e.g. `/apps/indexers`.
- Builder should automatically switch to "Dockerfile". If not, just wait a few seconds until it does.
- Change the "custom start command". Since this option changes the Docker's _entrypoint_, you will need to pass the full path to the `apibara-sink-*` executable. For example: `/nix/store/rh1g8pb7wfnyr527jfmkkc5lm3sa1f0l-apibara-sink-postgres-0.7.0/bin/apibara-sink-postgres run /app/my-indexer.ts`
- Change "restart policy" to "Always".
- Set the `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable to your DNA token.
- Set any other relevant environment variable needed by your indexer.
  - For Postgres: `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`
  - For Mongo: `MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING=${{MongoDB.MONGO_URL}}`
- Remember to whitelist environment variables used in your indexer with the
  `--allow-env-from-env` option or the `ALLOW_ENV_FROM_ENV` environment variable.
  See [the environment variables](/docs/indexers/permissions/environment) page
  for more information.
- Once deployed, you should see the indexer starting and running.

## Persisting state between restarts

The easiest way to [persist state between restarts](/docs/indexers/persistence)
on Railway is by using Redis.

- Deploy a new Redis instance on Railway, and wait for it to become ready.
- Update the following indexer's environment variables:
  - Set `PERSIST_TO_REDIS` to a reference to Redis' url: `${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}`.
  - Set `SINK_ID` to a unique id for this indexer, e.g. `my-indexer`.

After redeploying, you will notice that the indexer will store its state (like
latest indexed block) in the provided Redis instance.
