# Permissions

By default, Apibara indexers don't have access to environment variables,
network, and the filesystem. This is done to ensure no malicious Javascript
dependency can compromise your system.

In some cases, you need to loosen these restrictions to build your indexers.

Refer to the following pages to learn how to access:

- [Environment variables](/docs/v1/indexers/permissions/environment)
- [Network](/docs/v1/indexers/permissions/network)
- [The filesystem](/docs/v1/indexers/permissions/filesystem)
