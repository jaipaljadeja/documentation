# Persisting state

Apibara indexers are stateless by default, when it's restarted it will start
from the starting block again.

State includes:

- Cursor: the latest indexed block number and hash. Used on reconnect.
- Filter: if the indexer is using [factory mode](/docs/v1/indexers/factory-mode),
  this is the filter used for the main data stream.

When you enable persistence, you will need the following CLI option to name the indexer.

- `--indexer-id`: the unique id for the indexer. Alternatively, set the `INDEXER_ID`
  environment variable.

## File system persistence

Persist state to a JSON file on the file system. This option is mostly useful
for development and should not be used in production.

- `--persist-to-fs`: path to a folder where the state will be persisted.
  Alternatively, use the `PERSIST_TO_FS` environment variable.

## Redis

Persist state to a Redis server. This is currently the recommended option for
production usage.

- `--persist-to-redis`: Redis connection string. State will be persisted under
  the `apibara:indexers:<sink-id>` key. Alternatively, use the `PERSIST_TO_REDIS`
  environment variable.

## Etcd

Persist state to an Etcd cluster.

- `--persist-to-etcd`: Etcd connection string. Alternatively, use the
  `PERSIST_TO_ETCD` environment variable.

## Need more options?

We are looking for contributors to add persistence to PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
If you are interested in contributing this features, feel free to comment
in the [MongoDB persistence](https://github.com/apibara/dna/issues/333) or
[PostgreSQL persistence](https://github.com/apibara/dna/issues/334) issues.
